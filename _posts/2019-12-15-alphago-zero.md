title: A primer of Convolutional Neural Network
---

In the previous article we have seen the `MCTS` algorithm. this algorithm and all its variations have been
used to create a lot of AI for the game of Go. Indeed, `AlphaGo Zero`, the first Artificial Intelligence that was able to learn without the need of human supervision still use a variant of this algorithm. In this article we will
dissect the `AlphaGo Zero` Artificial Intelligence and I hope that, by the end of this article, even if you are not
an expert in machine learning, you will have understood how this AI works
