title: From A to Z Implementing AlphaGo Zero in TensorFlow
---

Hello Guys. It's been a while since I didn't write any article. I've been busy with a lot of other projects lately,
but I plan to release a detailed tutorial on how one can implement the AlphaGo Zero research paper. I have already implemented some components. The article will come out once everything has been tested. It will detail all the steps
needed to reimplement the [AlphaGo Zero paper](https://deepmind.com/documents/119/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf):
- Creating the Go game environment
- Developing the neural network using the TensorFlow Estimator API
- Implementing the MCTS algorithm with the `multiprocessing` package
- Implementing unit tests
- Deploying the model on Google Cloud Platform

The code is available on my Github: [https://github.com/Twice22/RL_project](https://github.com/Twice22/RL_project)  
This is a work in progress...
