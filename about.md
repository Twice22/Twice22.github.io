My name is Victor BUSA, after graduating from Télécom SudParis I started to work as a Developer/Consultant. I discovered the Machine Learning field in February 2016 and since I didn't stop to learn about it. I've followed numerous courses online. Be it Mooc, Courses (Materials freely available) from top Universities or books. I recently quit my job to go back to school (2017-2018) at the [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay) university ([Master MVA](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/master-mva-cours-2017-2018-161721.kjsp?RH=1242415112528)). I've started creating this blog to share the experiences that I'm acquiring during my studies and beyond.


I am still learning and I occasionally write articles (even if it is really time-consuming). This allows me to
deepen my knowledge, share it and keep a track of it. I am particularly interested about topics that involve
_Reinforcement Learning_ and _Natural Language Processing_.

On my free time, I learn chinese (1:30 to 2 hours a day, every day since May 5<sup>th</sup> 2016) and I read
lots of blog posts/books/research papers to sharpen my programming/machine learning skills. I also sharpen my algorithmic skills by solving programming challenges on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/twice22/ "leetcode").
