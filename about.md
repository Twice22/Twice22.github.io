My name is Victor. I had a Master Degree in Computer Science from Télécom SudParis. I was formely a Web Developer. I discovered the Machine Learning field in February 2016 and since didn't stop to learn about it. I've followed numerous courses only. Be it Mooc or Courses (Materials freely available) from top Universities. I recently quit my job and want to focus on learning more and more about Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning. I started creating this blog to share the experiences I'm acquiring in my path to becoming a Data Scientist.

### More Information

I'm currently available and will be delighted to start a PhD in the field of Machine Learning. If you are looking for someone motivated and interested in the field of Machine Learning don't hesitate to contact me.
