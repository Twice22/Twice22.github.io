My name is Victor, after graduating from Télécom SudParis I started to work as a Developer/Consultant. I discovered the Machine Learning field in February 2016 and since didn't stop to learn about it. I've followed numerous courses online. Be it Mooc or Courses (Materials freely available) from top Universities. I recently quit my job and want to focus on learning more and more about Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning. I started creating this blog to share the experiences I'm acquiring in my path to becoming a Data Scientist.
