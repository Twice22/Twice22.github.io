My name is Victor BUSA, I have an Engineer's degree in Computer Science as well as a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics From Ecole Normale Sup√©rieur de Paris-Saclay. I've started creating this blog to share the experiences that I'm acquiring during my studies and beyond.

I am still learning and I occasionally write articles (even if it is really time-consuming). This allows me to
deepen my knowledge, share it and keep a track of it. Even though I am working as a Deep Learning Engineer in the Computer Vision field,
I am also particularly interested about topics that involve **Reinforcement Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**

On my free time, I learn chinese and I read lots of blog posts/books/research papers to sharpen my programming/machine learning skills.
I also sharpen my algorithmic skills by solving programming challenges on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/twice22/ "leetcode").
