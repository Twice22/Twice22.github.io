My name is Victor, after graduating from Télécom SudParis I started to work as a Developer/Consultant. I discovered the Machine Learning field in February 2016 and since I didn't stop to learn about it. I've followed numerous courses online. Be it Mooc, Courses (Materials freely available) or books. I recently quit my job and want to focus on learning more and more about Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning. I've started creating this blog to share the experiences that I'm acquiring in my path to becoming a PhD student.
